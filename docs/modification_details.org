#+TITLE: modification details on the original play

Since William seems busy, and node exporter lacking the systemd
configs, I am making this fork.

*Points to recall:*
 * While running on system with old node_exporter configs, we would need to reload the systemd daemon, be sure you don't mess up with
other side-effects while running it on db servers(check it once, notsure I am)

 * jeos desing will include this play using ansible-galaxy like:
   - [[http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy.html#version][Eg]]; you can mention the REVISION(git commit hash) if you want to
be explicity about it, else just use the git url.
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     ansible-galaxy install git+https://github.com:thapakazi/ansible-prometheus.git,REVISION
     #+END_EXAMPLE
